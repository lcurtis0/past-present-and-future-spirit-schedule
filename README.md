# Ironage-Boar (Challenge-1)

## Description

This files are created to complete the Module one challenge-1

I want the client to have a proper marketing website that always can be easily edited at a moments notice.

Now the client should be able to navigate the HTML and CSS file with ease and edit more easily using the same class names.

I learned that there can be several elements in a class for CSS and that not all HTML tags can have the same class for CSS.

## Usage

In this asignment we were taught to understand organized HTML structure, logical styling and positioning, and make sure all elements were in sequential order.

For the webpage a user can use the nav bar link, have sections and read alt attributes.
